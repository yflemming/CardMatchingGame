Card Matching with deck is complete
-Set Card game is incomplete: Card display incomplete/ game logic incomplete

At the start screen choose either set, or card card matching game:
Card matching game creates a table of randomly generated playing cards and allows the user to play one of two modes,
either a 2 card matching game, or a 3 card matching game. Points are awarded based of relevance of match i.e. suit/number

Set card game does not yet display cards, but the matching logic should be fine.
